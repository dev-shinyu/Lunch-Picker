# N78 Meal Menu Picker: The Cure for Decision Paralysis

> “What should I eat today?”
> The oldest, most profound question in humanity.
> To spare your team from this agony, behold the Lunch Picker—like a divine revelation for indecisive minds.
> No more sheepishly mumbling “Anything”—entrust your meals to destiny… or rather, to our algorithm.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy

- **Fairness**: Every option gets an equal chance. (Hint: Yesterday’s pick is automatically excluded.)
- **Transparency**: Watch the dazzling roulette spin as your appetite turns.
- **Speed**: From a quick 3-second dash to a suspenseful 15-second countdown—choose the tempo that matches your hunger.

## ✨ Key Features (Magic in Disguise)

- **Fate’s Roulette**: Not just random—powered by cutting-edge `random.choice` to pinpoint your next meal with algorithmic precision.
- **Yesterday Exclusion**: “Didn’t we just have that yesterday?”—never fear. Our built-in ‘no-repeat’ AI ensures yesterday’s choice sits out.
- **Comprehensive Stats**: See which dishes have looted your wallet the most. The top contender earns the crown (👑)—maybe flash it to the chef for a freebie?
- **Add/Remove Options**: Add new delights to the list or banish those you don’t crave with a single click. Your fingertip holds their fate.
- **Custom Countdown**: Impatient? Go for a 3-second sprint. Craving drama? Stretch it to 15 seconds. Pick the thrill level.
